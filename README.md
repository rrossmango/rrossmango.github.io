## Welcome to ryanrossmango.com :space_invader:

pov: you are searching the files for my state-of-the-art personal website

### What's in it? :paintbrush:

.css style files and .html files to make these pages:
- About (homepage)
- Engineering (professional and portfolio)
- Education (my ucla years)
- Hobbies (how I have fun!)
- Blog (my miscellaneous thoughts on miscellaneous things)
- Skills (a breakdown of my toolbelt and where I acquired them)

### Why? :hammer_and_wrench:

- To continue learning coding and Git
- To expand my personal spider web (showcasing myself all over the web :D)
- To let companies/people know more about me, beyond a 1-page resume

### Emojis
